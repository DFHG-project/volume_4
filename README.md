## DFHG Volumen Quartum

This repository stores data from the [DFHG project](http://www.dfhg-project.org/) - [Volumen Quartum](http://www.dfhg-project.org/DFHG/index.php?volume=Volumen%20quartum).

The volume contains fragments of authors from the beginning of the reign of Costantine the Great in 306 CE through the reign of the emperor Phocas (602-610 CE) including also the works of John of Antioch.

`xml` files have been automatically generated from data stored in the DFHG database and are encoded in accordance with the CTS/CITE Architecture.
The repository contains two kinds of files arranged by DFHG authors:
* Epidoc `xml` files that are encoded in accordance with EpiDoc standards and represent the structure of the edition of the FHG.
* Well formed `xml` files that collect information about fragments and extant texts collected in the FHG.
